    <h1>Consent to Participate in Research</h1>
    <h2>Study Title: Autonomous Negotiation using Comparison-Based Optimization</h2>
    <p><strong>Conducted By:</strong> Surya Murthy, Ph.D. student, Department of Computer Engineering</p>
    <p><strong>Faculty Advisor:</strong> Ufuk Topcu, Professor, Department of Aerospace Engineering</p>

    <p>You are invited to be part of a research study. This consent form will help you choose whether or not to participate in the study. It is totally up to you to decide to be in this research study. Participating in this study is voluntary. Your decision to participate will not affect your relationship with The University of Texas at Austin. You will not lose any benefits or rights you already had if you decide not to participate. Even if you decide to be a part of the study now, you may change your mind and stop at any time. You do not have to answer any questions you do not want to answer.</p>

    <h3>The purpose of the study:</h3>
    <p>We have developed an algorithm to facilitate negotiations between two parties. The two parties have a set of items that they trade with each other. The algorithm knows the preferences of one party and makes trade offers on behalf of the party. The algorithm aims to find satisfactory trades that would be beneficial for both parties. We would like to test our algorithm in settings with human negotiators to determine its strengths and limitations. In particular, we would like to test whether the algorithm can find mutually beneficial trades when negotiating with humans. We will measure information like the number of offers that the algorithm makes and the benefit it obtains with each successful trade and the human’s level of satisfaction with the trade.</p>

    <p>If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to engage in a hypothetical trading scenario with an autonomous negotiation algorithm. There are no real-world implications associated with these scenarios. At the start of the trading scenario, you will be provided with a prompt that will describe the negotiation setting and motivate your trades with the algorithm. At the beginning of the scenario, you will start with a set of items that you will hypothetically own. To understand whether the trades are aligned with your preferences, you will also be asked for a target number of items you would like to obtain through trading.</p>

    <p>During the negotiation process, our algorithm will provide trade offers, and you will respond using a text input within two minutes after each offer. If you accept the trade offer, you will exchange items with the other party and continue trading with the new item amounts. If you reject the offer, the algorithm will continue making offers. You can also provide the algorithm with additional feedback on the trade offers through text. The trading process will continue until you feel satisfied with the current number of items.</p>

    <p>As a comparison to our algorithm, we use an existing large language model (e.g., ChatGPT) to facilitate negotiation. Instead of interacting with our algorithm, you may interact with the large language model. At the beginning of the scenario, you will be informed about who you are interacting with.</p>

    <p>We expect that this study will take about 10-20 minutes. If you spend more than two minutes without providing a response to the algorithm, the study will end, and you will be redirected to the payment information screen.</p>

    <h3>Risks/Benefits:</h3>
    <p>The risk associated with this study is no greater than everyday life. There are no direct benefits to you for participating in the study. The study may help us understand how autonomous systems can interact with humans and identify their preferences.</p>

    <h3>Compensation:</h3>
    <p>You will receive payment for participating in this study. The hourly rate is $12 per hour. The payment is expected to be $2-4 depending on the time you take to complete the trading scenario (max 20 min). After the study is complete, you will be given a completion code that you can use to certify the study’s completion via Prolific. The payment will be provided through Prolific in the form of PayPal once the study has been completed and approved. The outcome of the hypothetical trading scenario will not affect your compensation. You will be responsible for any taxes assessed on the compensation.</p>

    <h3>Confidentiality and Privacy Protections:</h3>
    <p>As a part of this study, we will collect your Prolific ID, a string of numbers and letters, to distribute payment to you. Your Prolific ID will not be stored with the research data we collect from you. The records of this study will be stored securely, and the data will be anonymized. Authorized persons from The University of Texas at Austin and members of the Institutional Review Board have the legal right to review your research records and will protect the confidentiality of those records to the extent permitted by law. All publications related to this study will exclude any information that will make it possible to identify you as a subject. We may share your data or samples with other researchers for future research studies that may be similar to this study or may be very different. The data or samples shared with other researchers will not include information that can directly identify you. We will keep the anonymized research data to use for future research studies that may be similar to this study or may be very different. We will not attempt to re-identify participants in any way.</p>
