        <h1>Consent to Participate in Research</h1>
        <h2>Study Title: Autonomous Negotiation using Comparison-Based Optimization</h2>

        <p><strong>Conducted By:</strong> Surya Murthy, Ph.D. Student, Department of Computer Engineering</p>
        <p><strong>Faculty Advisor:</strong> Ufuk Topcu, Professor, Department of Aerospace Engineering</p>

        <p>You are invited to be part of a research study. This consent form will help you choose whether or not to participate in the study. It is totally up to you to decide to be in this research study. Participating in this study is voluntary. Your decision to participate will not affect your relationship with The University of Texas at Austin. You will not lose any benefits or rights you already had if you decide not to participate. Even if you decide to be a part of the study now, you may change your mind and stop at any time. You do not have to answer any questions you do not want to answer.</p>

        <h3>The purpose of the study:</h3>
        <p>We have developed an algorithm to facilitate negotiations between two parties. The two parties have a set of items that they trade with each other. The algorithm knows the preferences of one party, and makes trade offers on behalf of the party. The algorithm aims to find satisfactory trades that would be beneficial for both parties. We would like to test our algorithm in settings with human negotiators to determine its strengths and limitations. In particular, we would like to test whether the algorithm can find mutually beneficial trades when negotiating with humans. We will measure information like the number of offers that the algorithm makes, the benefit it obtains with each successful trade, and the human’s level of satisfaction with the trade.</p>

        <h3>Risks/Benefits:</h3>
        <p>The risk associated with this study is no greater than everyday life. There are no direct benefits to you for participating in the study. The study may help us understand how autonomous systems can interact with humans and identify their preferences.</p>

        <h3>Compensation:</h3>
        <p>You will receive a baseline payment for participating in this study, which will not be affected by the outcome of the trading scenario. The baseline payment is $3.00 for 15 minutes, equivalent to an hourly rate of $12. After completing the study, you will be redirected to Prolific to certify its completion. Payment will be processed through Prolific once the study has been approved.</p>
        <p>In addition to the baseline payment, <strong>you will be eligible for a bonus payment based on how close you come to achieving your target item amounts during the study</strong>. The bonus is calculated using the following formula:</p>
        <p>Bonus Payment = $3 × (1 - (|Final Amounts - Target Amounts| ÷ |Initial Amounts - Target Amounts|))</p>
        <p>Here:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Final Amounts</strong> refers to the amounts of each item you end with.</li>
            <li><strong>Target Amounts</strong> refers to the desired amounts specified as your goal.</li>
            <li><strong>Initial Amounts</strong> refers to the starting amounts of each item.</li>
        </ul>
        The closer your final amounts are to your target amounts, the higher your bonus payment. If your final amounts exactly match your target amounts, you will receive the full $3 bonus.</p>
        <p>Overall, your total compensation will include the baseline payment plus any bonus payment earned. You will be responsible for any taxes assessed on the compensation.</p>

        <h3>Confidentiality and Privacy Protections:</h3>
        <p>As a part of this study, we will collect your Prolific ID, a string of numbers and letters, to distribute payment to you. Your Prolific ID will not be stored with the research data we collect from you. The records of this study will be stored securely, and the data will be anonymized. Authorized persons from The University of Texas at Austin, and members of the Institutional Review Board have the legal right to review your research records and will protect the confidentiality of those records to the extent permitted by law. All publications related to this study will exclude any information that will make it possible to identify you as a subject. We may share your data or samples with other researchers for future research studies that may be similar to this study or may be very different. The data or samples shared with other researchers will not include information that can directly identify you. We will keep the anonymized research data to use for future research studies that may be similar to this study or may be very different. We will not attempt to re-identify participants in any way.</p>
